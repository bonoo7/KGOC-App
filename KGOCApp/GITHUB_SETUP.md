# GitHub Setup Commands

## After creating your GitHub repository, run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd C:\Users\6rga3\KGOC\KGOCApp

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace with your details)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Rename branch to main (GitHub standard)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Repository Structure
Your project contains:
- ✅ React Native Expo app with web support
- ✅ Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-In
- ✅ Firestore database integration
- ✅ Role-based access control system
- ✅ Dashboard with Well Test, Well Services, Administrations
- ✅ User roles: welltester, operator, supervisor, coordinator, administrator, admin
- ✅ Complete project documentation

## Security Note
Make sure to set your GitHub repository as **Private** since it contains Firebase configuration.

## Next Steps After GitHub Setup
1. Clone the repository on other devices: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development: `npx expo start --web`

## Firebase Configuration
Your Firebase config is already included in the project. Make sure:
1. Firebase Authentication is enabled
2. Google Sign-In is configured
3. Firestore rules allow authenticated users:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
