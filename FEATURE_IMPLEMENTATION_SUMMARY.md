- ✅ **Visual Distinction**: Existing wells marked with green badges and colors
- ✅ **Quick Access**: Shows top 3 suggestions inline, full list in modal

#### **Enhanced UX**
- ✅ **Auto-completion**: Suggests based on existing well numbers in database
- ✅ **Pattern Generation**: Creates logical well number suggestions
- ✅ **Clear Button**: Easy input clearing with focus retention
- ✅ **Loading States**: Visual feedback during search operations
